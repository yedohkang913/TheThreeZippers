2017-06-02

1. Which jobs are most crucial?
   In order of priority:
   A. Writing Driver.java:
      An important class that will bring everything together, allowing the user to actually run and use the program/tool.
   B. Adding comments, fixing code, making it look neater, adding more options to the Driver.java
   C. adding a GUI (colors!)

2. Which components constitute core functionality (vs non-essential)?
      Core functionality: writing Driver.java so that the user can use the program.

3. Which components are prerequisites for others?
      Everything else.

4. Which tasks can be delegated, and which must be collaboratively tackled?
      Driver.java must be collaboratively tackled. We will then, on our own, review and test everything, and then talk about what we discovered
      and fix them together unless it's a quick, minor change. 

5. What is the timeline, and how does it accommodate setbacks, course changes?	
      This timeline allows sufficient time for change, and leaves a few days to make crucial changes/fix things.
