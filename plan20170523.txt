Dictionary Frenzy!: Plan #2
2017-05-23

1. Which jobs are most crucial?
   In order of priority:
   A. Writing Driver.java (or some rough outline of it using comments): 
      This will give us a sense of how the entire program is going to function, so all of us will be on the same page. This           
      will also help us in figuring out how to incorporate the Dictionary--how searching and creating a Flashcard instance                     
      and adding words will be done.
   B. Writing Word.java: 
      The most basic class for Dictionary Frenzy! to function.
   C. Writing Set.java: 
      The second most basic class for Dictionary Frenzy! to function, using Word objects. We will also use this class to 
      figure out how exactly Flashcards, Learn, AsteroidGravity, and Matching to what extent the queue of Words in each 
      Flashcard 
      instance will be accessed and modified.
   D. Writing Dictionary.java:
      An important class that uses binary search to search for the word and its definition. Important to the program itself
      because it allows the user to access definitions and words.
   E. Writing Flashcard.java, Learn.java, AsteroidGravity.java, and Matching.java:
      These classes are the final part; they will allow the users to practice their sets of words through either the 
      Flashcard function, the Learn function, a game of Asteroid Gravity, or the Matching function. These classes will
      mainly involve user input and display through the terminal. 

2. Which components constitute core functionality (vs non-essential)?
      A core function is the search method to find a word in a dictionary. We will need this to add words. Writing the word   
      class is the most crucial because the words are the backbone for the entire program. The Set class is also 
      essential because they are implemented by Flashcard.java, Learn.java, AsteroidGravity.java, and Matching.java. 

3. Which components are prerequisites for others?
      Word.java is needed to make flashcards. Sets are required to make Flashcards.java, Learn.java, AsteroidGravity.java, 
      Matching.java.

4. Which tasks can be delegated, and which must be collaboratively tackled?
      Writing the Word, Set, and Driver class must be collaboratively tackled because they are the core classes. 
      They are important for the other classes to function, and it would be best if we had three people looking over the            
      code and writing it together with similar ideas, rather than having one person write it. It will also help everyone 
      understand how these classes function, so writing Flashcards.java, Learn.java, Asteroid.java, and Matching.java will
      be easier for all of us. We are going to try working on all the other classes together so that it's easier for us to 
      carry the task out and be on the same page, but if it is impossible, we will delegate the later classes.

5. What is the timeline, and how does it accommodate setbacks, course changes?	
      This timeline allows sufficient time for change, and leaves a few days to make crucial changes/fix things.
      COMPLETE BY MIDNIGHT: 
            *make changes necessary as we go
            *remember to add comments!
            *make changes to the Driver file along the way
	    *WORK ON DICTIONARY.JAVA ALONG THE WAY!!
      5/19 - Word.java (DONE)
      5/20 - Set.java (DONE)
      5/22 - Flashcard.java (DONE)
      5/24 - Learn.java (DONE)
      5/26 - Matching.java
      5/29 - Dictionary.java
      6/2 - Driver.java
      6/6 - Make/add additional changes/features if necessary; Test cases (test out the program); Make code neater and easier to read; etc.
